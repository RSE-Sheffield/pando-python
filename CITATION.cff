abstract: >-
  This lesson introduces the basics of profiling and
  optimising Python code. The course is designed to be
  accessible to Python users of all skill levels (beyond
  total beginner). The optimisations presented should be
  considered performance best practices, they are
  demonstrated with small programming patterns that
  demonstrate multiple approaches in code to achieve the
  same result with differing performance.
