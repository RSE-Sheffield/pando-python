## Glossary

Benchmarking
: The process of running a program in order to assess it's overall performance. This can be useful to confirm the impact of optimisations.

Bottleneck
: The component with the lowest throughput, which limits performance of the overall program. Improving the throughput of this component should improve the overall performance.

*Bottleneck is a synonym of limiting factor.*

Call Stack
: The internal stack data-structure used during the execution of code, that tracks metadata related to the currently executing hierarchy of function calls. Elements in the call stack are referred to as stack frames.

`cProfile`
: A function level profiler provided by the Python standard library.

Hot Path
: The parts of the code that are executed very frequently during normal operation.

Latency
: The time taken for an operation to complete.

Limiting Factor
: The component with the lowest throughput, which limits performance of the overall program. Improving the throughput of this component should improve the overall performance.

*Limiting factor is a synonym of bottleneck.*

`line_profiler`
: A line level profiler for Python that can be installed via `pip`.

Pop
: The action of removing the top item from a stack data-structure (sometimes also used in reference to removing and returning the first item from a list or queue).

Profiling
: The measuring and analysis of granular performance metrics of a program, to understand where time is being spent during execution. Typically used to prioritise optimisation.

Push
: The action of adding an item to the top of a stack data-structure (sometimes also used in reference to appending an item to a list or queue).

Recursive
: A recursive function or algorithm is one that calls itself. Too many recursive calls, can lead to stack overflow exceptions. Most recursive functions can be restructured as loops.

`snakeviz`
: A web-browser based visualisation tool for `cProfile` outputs that can be installed via `pip`.

Stack
: A last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure. Similar in nature to a physical stack (e.g. of books), items are added to the top and those below the top cannot be accessed without first removing the ones above them.

Stack Frame
: The term used to refer to elements within the call stack. A call stack's stack frame will contain metadata about a particular function call, such as where it was called from and any variables that have been allocated 'on the stack' within the function's local scope. When a stack frame is popped from the call stack, any variables allocated within the corresponding function's local scope would be deallocated.

`viztracer`
: A timeline profiler for Python that can be installed via `pip`.
