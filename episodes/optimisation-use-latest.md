## Introduction

<!-- Why it's important to use the most recent Python and packages viable -->
It's important to use the latest Python wherever feasible. In addition to new features and fixes, much work has been completed over the lifetime of Python 3 to improve the performance of the language.

> [Python 3.11](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html) is between 10-60% faster than Python 3.10. On average, we measured a 1.25x speedup on the standard benchmark suite.

Future proposals, such as changes to the [JIT](https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/python-gets-a-jit.html) and [GIL](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/) will provide further improvements to performance.

Similarly, major packages with a performance focus such as NumPy and Pandas, should be kept up to date for the same reasons.

<!-- performance regressions for major packages are rare -->
These improvements are often free, requiring minimal changes to any code (unlike the jump from Python 2 to Python 3).

Performance regressions within major packages should be considered rare, they often track performance alongside their test suites.

<!-- Not always possible due to incompatibilities -->
However, the more packages and language features your code touches, and the older the Python it currently uses, the greater chance of incompatibilities making it difficult to upgrade.

<!-- Updates may include breaking changes, important to have validation inplace to ensure results aren't affected -->
Similar to optimising, when updating it's important to have tests in place to validate the correctness of your code before and after changes.
An update to a single small dependent package could introduce a breaking change.
This could cause your code to crash, or worse subtly change your results.


## Updating Python & Packages

<!-- Not as relevant if you are starting from scratch -->
*This isn't as relevant if you're starting from scratch. Simply make sure you've installed the latest Python before you start.*


<!-- todo recommended way, because Python is incredibly bad at this -->

<!-- Worth also mentioning for same reason, to have requirements.txt? -->



::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Where feasible, the latest version of Python and packages should be used as they can include significant free improvements to the performance of your code.
- There is a risk that updating Python or packages will not be possible to due to version incompatibilities or will require breaking changes to your code.
- Changes to packages may impact results output by your code, ensure you have a method of validation ready prior to attempting upgrades.
