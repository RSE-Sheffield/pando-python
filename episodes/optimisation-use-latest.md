:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- Why would a newer version of Python or a package be faster?
- Are there any risks to updating Python and packages?
- How can reproducibility be ensured through package upgrades?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Able to explain why using the latest versions of Python and packages is beneficial.
- Able to identify when updating is not possible due to incompatibilities. 
- Able to ensure code remains reproducible through package changes.

## Introduction

<!-- Why it's important to use the most recent Python viable -->

<!-- To a lesser degree this applies to many (major) packages -->

<!-- Not always possible due to incompatibilities -->

<!-- Updates may include breaking changes -->

<!-- Important to have validation inplace to ensure results aren't affected -->

<!-- This is also good practice when optimising your code, to ensure mistakes aren't made -->

## Ensuring Reproducible Results

<!-- todo -->

## Updating Python & Packages

<!-- Not as relevant if you are starting from scratch -->

<!-- todo recommended way -->



::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Where feasible, the latest version of Python and packages should be used as they can include significant free improvements to the performance of your code.
- There is a risk that updating Python or packages will not be possible to due to version incompatibilities or will require breaking changes to your code.
- Changes to packages may impact results output by your code, ensure you have a method of validation ready prior to attempting upgrades.
