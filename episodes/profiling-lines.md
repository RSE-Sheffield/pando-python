:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- When is line level profiling appropriate?
- What adjustments are required to Python code to profile with `line_profiler`?
- How can `kernprof` be used to profile a Python program?
<!-- Last two overlap somewhat -->

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- decorate Python code to prepare it for profiling with `line_profiler`
- execute a Python program via `kernprof` to collect profiling information about a Python program’s execution
- interpret output from `line_profiler`, to identify the lines where time is being spent during a program’s execution

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

<!-- Context -->
Whilst profiling, you may find that function-level profiling highlights expensive methods where you can't easily determine the cause of the cost due to their complexity.

<!-- What -->
Line level profiling allows you to target specific methods to collect more granular metrics, which can help narrow the source of expensive computation further. Typically line-level profiling will calculate the number of times each line is called and the total time spent executing each line. However, with the increased granularity come increased collection costs, which is why it's targeted to specific methods.

<!-- Why -->
This allows lines that occupy a disproportionate amount of the total runtime to be quickly identified and investigated.

<!-- We will be covering -->
In this episode we will cover the usage of the line-level profiler `line_profiler`, how your code should be modified to target the profiling and how the output can be interpreted.

## line_profiler

<!-- what is line_profiler, how is it installed -->
[`line_profiler`](https://kernprof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/line_profiler.html#line-profiler-basic-usage) is a line-level profiler which provides both text output and visualisation.

<!--TODO is covering pip here redundant as it's covered in the user setup file? -->
It is not part of the Python standard library, and therefore must be installed via pip.

```sh
pip install line_profiler[all]
```

To use `line_profiler` decorate methods to be profiled with `@profile` which is imported from `line_profiler`.

For example, the below code:

```python
def is_prime(number):
    if number < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
    
print(is_prime(1087))
```

Would be updated to:

```python
from line_profiler import profile

@profile
def is_prime(number):
    if number < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
    
print(is_prime(1087))
```

This tells `line_profiler` to collect metrics for the lines within the method `is_prime()`.
You can still execute your code as normal, and these changes will have no effect.

Similar to the earlier tools, `line_profiler` can then be triggered via `kernprof`.

```sh
python -m kernprof -lvr my_script.py
```

This will output a table per profiled method to console:

```output
Wrote profile results to my_script.py.lprof
Timer unit: 1e-06 s

Total time: 1.65e-05 s
File: my_script.py
Function: is_prime at line 3

Line #      Hits         Time  Per Hit   % Time  Line Contents
==============================================================
     3                                           @profile
     4                                           def is_prime(number):
     5         1          0.4      0.4      2.4      if number < 2:
     6                                                   return False
     7        32          8.4      0.3     50.9      for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):
     8        31          7.4      0.2     44.8          if number % i == 0:
     9                                                       return False
    10         1          0.3      0.3      1.8      return True
```

The columns have the following definitions:

| Column | Definition |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `Line #`  | The line number of the relevant line within the file (specified above the table). |
| `Hits` | The total number of times the line was executed. |
| `Time` | The total time spent executing that line, including child function calls. |
| `Per Hit` | The average time per call, including child function calls (`Time`/`Hits`). |
| `% Time` | The time spent executing the line, including child function calls, relative to the other lines of the function. |
| `Line Contents` | A copy of the line from the file. |

As `line_profiler` must be attached to specific methods and cannot attach to a full Python file or project,
if your Python file has significant code in the global scope it will be necessary to move it into a new method which can then instead be called from global scope.

The profile is also output to file, in this case `my_script.py.lprof`.
This file is not human-readable, but can be printed to console by passing it to `line_profiler`, which will then display the same table as above.

```sh
python -m line_profiler -rm my_script.py.lprof
```
<!-- TODO line_profiling significantly slows down the profiled methods. Is it possible to dynamically disable/enable profiling with `line_profiler`? kernprof -h implies so, but trial/error and docs is failing me -->

## Worked Example

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

## Follow Along

Download the <a href="files/line_profiler-worked-example/fizzbuzz.py" download>Python source for the example</a> and follow along with the worked example on your own machine.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

To more clearly demonstrate how to use `line_profiler`, the below implementation of "FizzBuzz" will be line profiled.

```python
n = 100
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
```

As there are no methods, firstly it should be updated to move the code to be profiled into a method:

```python
def fizzbuzz(n):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)

fizzbuzz(100)
```

Next the method can be decorated with `@profile` which must be imported via `line_profiler`:

```python
from line_profiler import profile

@profile
def fizzbuzz(n):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)

fizzbuzz(100)
```

Now that the code has been decorated, it can be profiled!

```sh
python -m kernprof -lvr fizzbuzz.py
```

This will output a table per profiled method to console:

*If you run this locally it should be highlighted due to `-r` passed to `kernprof`.*

```output
Wrote profile results to fizzbuzz.py.lprof
Timer unit: 1e-06 s

Total time: 0.0021535 s

==============================================================
     3                                           @profile
     4                                           def fizzbuzz(n):
     5       101         32.5      0.3      1.5      for i in range(1, n + 1):
     6       100         26.9      0.3      1.2          if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
     7         6        125.8     21.0      5.8              print("FizzBuzz")
     8        94         16.7      0.2      0.8          elif i % 3 == 0:
     9        27        541.3     20.0     25.1              print("Fizz")
    10        67         12.4      0.2      0.6          elif i % 5 == 0:
    11        14        285.1     20.4     13.2              print("Buzz")
    12                                                   else:
    13        53       1112.8     21.0     51.7              print(i)
```

For this basic example, we can calculate that "FizzBuzz" would be printed 6 times out of 100, and the profile shows that line 7 (`print("FizzBuzz")`) occupied 5.8% of the runtime. This is slightly lower than 6% due to the control flow code (printing to console is expensive relative to the control flow and conditional statements). Similarly, "Fizz" is printed 27 times and occupies 25.1%, likewise "Buzz" is printed 14 times and occupies 13.2%. Each print statement has a similar "Per Hit" time of 20-21 micro seconds.

Therefore it can be seen in this example, how the time spent executing each line matches expectations.

## Rich Output

The `-r` argument passed to `kernprof` (or `line_profiler`) enables rich output, if you run the profile locally it should look similar to this. *This requires the optional package `rich`, it will have been installed if `[all]` was specified when installing `line_profiler` with `pip`.*

## Exercises

The following exercises allow you to review your understanding of what has been covered in this episode.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Exercise 1: BubbleSort

Download and profile <a href="files/bubblesort/bubblesort.py" download>the Python bubblesort implementation</a>, line-level profile the code to investigate where time is being spent. 

> Bubblesort is a basic sorting algorithm, it is not considered to be efficient so in practice other sorting algorithms are typically used.
>
> The array to be sorted is iterated, with a pair-wise sort being applied to each element and it's neighbour.
> This can cause elements to rise (or sink) multiple positions in a single pass, hence the name bubblesort.
> This iteration continues until the array is fully iterated with no elements being swapped.

The program can be executed via `python bubblesort.py <elements>`.
The value of `elements` should be a positive integer as it represents the number of elements to be sorted.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: hint

- Remember that the code needs to be moved into a method decorated with `@profile`
- This must be imported via `from line_profiler import profile`
- 100 elements should be suitable for a quick profile

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

If you chose to profile the whole code, it may look like this:

```python
import sys
import random
from line_profiler import profile        # Import profile decorator

@profile                                 # Decorate the function to be profiled
def main():                              # Create a simple function with the code to be profiled
    # Argument parsing
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Script expects 1 positive integer argument, %u found."%(len(sys.argv) - 1))
        sys.exit()
    n = int(sys.argv[1])
    # Init
    random.seed(12)
    arr = [random.random() for i in range(n)]
    print("Sorting %d elements"%(n))
    # Sort
    for i in range(n - 1):
        swapped = False
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        # If no two elements were swapped in the inner loop, the array is sorted
        if not swapped:
            break
    # Validate
    is_sorted = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
            is_sorted = False
    print("Sorting: %s"%("Passed" if is_sorted else "Failed"))
    
main()                                  # Call the created function
```

The sort can be profiled with 100 elements, this is quick and should be representative.

```sh
python -m kernprof -lvr bubblesort.py 100
```

This produces output:

    23                                                   # If no two elements were swapped in the inner loop, the array…
    24        95         15.2      0.2      0.5          if not swapped:
    25         1          0.2      0.2      0.0              break
    26                                               # Validate

    28       100         12.9      0.1      0.4      for i in range(n - 1):
    29        99         20.3      0.2      0.7          if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
    30                                                       is_sorted = False
    31         1         21.5     21.5      0.7      print("Sorting: %s"%("Passed" if is_sorted else "Failed"))
```

From this we can identify that the print statements were the most expensive individual calls ("Per Hit"), however both were only called once.
Most execution time was spent at the inner loop (lines 19-22).

As this is a reference implementation of a classic sorting algorithm we are unlikely to be able to improve it further.

## Exercise 2: Predator Prey

During the function-level profiling episode, <a href="files/pred-prey/predprey.py" download>the Python predator prey model</a> was function-level profiled.
This highlighted that `Grass::eaten()` (from `predprey.py:278`) occupies the majority of the runtime.

Line-profile this method, using the output from the profile consider how it might be optimised.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: hint

- Remember that the function needs to be decorated with `@profile`
- This must be imported via `from line_profiler import profile`
- Line-level profiling `Grass::eaten()`, the most called function will slow it down significantly. You may wish to reduce the number of steps `predprey.py:305`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

First the function must be decorated

```python
# line ~1
from line_profiler import profile
```

```python
# line ~278
    @profile
    def eaten(self, prey_list):
```

`line_profiler` can then be executed via `python -m kernprof -lvr predprey.py`.

This will take much longer to run due to `line_profiler`, you may wish to reduce the number of steps. In this instance it may change the profiling output slightly, as the number of `Prey` and their member variables evaluated by this method both change as the model progresses, but the overall pattern is likely to remain similar.

```python
# line ~420
model = Model(50) # 50 steps (originally defaulted to 250)
```

Alternatively, you can kill the profiling process (e.g. `ctrl + c`) after a minute and the currently collected partial profiling information will be output.

This will produce output similar to that below.

From the profiling output it can be seen that lines 285-287 occupy over 90% of the method's runtime!

```python
            for i in range(len(prey_list)):
                prey = prey_list[i]
                if prey.life < PREY_HUNGER_THRESH:
```

Given that the following line 289 only has a relative 0.6% time, it can be understood that the vast majority of times the condition `prey.life < PREY_HUNGER_THRESH` is evaluated it does not proceed.

Remembering that this method is executed once per each of the 5000 `Grass` agents each step of the model, it could make sense to pre-filter `prey_list` once each timestep before it is passed to `Grass::eaten()`. This would greatly reduce the number of `Prey` iterated, reducing the cost of the method.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Specific methods can be line-level profiled if decorated with `@profile` that is imported from `line_profiler`.
- `kernprof` executes `line_profiler` via `python -m kernprof -lvr <script name> <arguments>`.
- Code in global scope must wrapped in a method if it is to be profiled with `line_profiler`.
- The output from `line_profiler` lists the absolute and relative time spent per line for each targeted function.
